# Square-wave-using-fourier-series
It will generate square wave by using fourier integral  in MATLAB

We are using fourier series to generate square wave. In matlab we are plotting square wave for diffrent no of itteration in series of fourier. we are also calculating the value of value of constant An and Bn.
